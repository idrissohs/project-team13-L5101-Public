Our competition are sites like Watch2gether and Youtube. Watch2gether let's you create private rooms and watch videos with your friends. Youtube lets you watch videos uploaded by random users. 

Our product DEOHOUSE is a bit different. Unlike Watch2gether where there are only private rooms, our product will have public rooms organised by content. Ofcourse you can also create your private room. Using DEOHOUSE you can watch videos with random people. It's for lazy people, who want to be entertained without having to constantly decide what to watch next or for people who don't know what to watch. Each public room will play videos of a specific category. So a person who wants to watch music videos can go to the music video room and just enjoy what other people play. Youtube does not let you watch together with other people. It also requires you to know what you want to watch. If you don't know what to watch, you will have to browse through videos untill you find one that you like. And you don't always have the time for that.

In DEOHOUSE, users will be rated for what they play. Users that have a really low rating won't be allowed to play their video unless all the users in the room have a low rating. This will ensure that better videos will be played in the rooms. Our product is targeted towards people who have amazing videos to share and people who want to watch something new.
