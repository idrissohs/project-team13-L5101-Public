Process:
-Prior to our first team meeting, we initially communicated through email

-We brainstormed a rough plan of what our project would be by making suggestions and working off of each otherâ€™s ideas.

-At our first team meeting, on Thursday Oct 8th, we solidified our idea for what the final project might be and started discussing potential ideas for what to write for our deliverables.

-Discussing potential competition, personas, and user-stories as a group, helped us gain further insight as to what our completed project would look like.

-To better our communication between group members, we connected through Facebook to create a group chat with all members.

-We also use Google Docs in order easily exchange ideas for deliverables between members and have a collective place to store our work.

-At our next meeting with Mahtab, on Thursday Oct 15th, we talked about our plan for the future of our project and how we will implement that plan.

-We also decided how we would distribute some of the workload.

 -Going forward with upcoming phases of the project we plan on having group meetings more often in addition to meeting every Thursday.
