Sprint Backlog (Rafael)

Refer to PDF file : Sprint-Backlog.pdf


Initial Meeting: (Adib)

Idriss has volunteered to be the scrum master for this phase. As a scrum master his duties will be:
●	Schedule meetings based on the availability of the majority of the group members.
●	Set up a parse project, and add the rest of the group members as collaborators.
●	Add Issues to github, and assign tasks based on members’ preference.
●	Responsible for ensuring that tasks are completed on time.
●	Assign new tasks to members.
●	Responsible for helping group members set up the necessary tools needed to develop our code.
○	Parse JS SDK
○	Set up account keys to access files on parse server

We decided to categorize tasks to 3 different sizes:

1.	S(small): Tasks that would take less than 2 hours to complete, or no more than 20 lines of code.
2.	M(medium): Tasks that would take more than 2 hours, but less than a day to complete, or more than 20 lines of code but less than 50 lines of code.
3.	L(large): Tasks that would take more than a day to complete, or any tasks that requires more than 50 lines of code.







BurnDown Chart: (Cameron)
In this folder under “Team BurnDown.png”

Left axis is amount of work by task size, with the legend of:
Small Tasks = 1
Medium Tasks = 2
Large Tasks = 4

We chose this system because medium tasks are roughly double the size of small tasks. and large tasks are roughly double the size of medium tasks.

With individual Charts people were given the full points for tasks they did with others, that way it was easy to make your chart by just looking at the task size (s/m/l) for all of the tasks you were part of. The task table we looked at to calculate our work done is attached as "Task Table.rtf".








Updated Meetings: (Joel)

Meeting 1
Time: 21/10/2015 2:30 PM
Location: Bahen 3200
Participants: All group members

●	Decided to use parse as the framework.

●	Reviewed users stories, and voted on which ones to tackle in this phase.
●	The scrum master chose Saturday, at 7:30 p.m., for us to meet on facebook and discuss completion of the profile page and user authentication

Meeting 2
Time: 24/10/2015 7:30 PM
Location: Facebook chat
Participants: All group members

●	Assigned the profile page task, which was originally assigned to Idriss, to Adib
●	Assigned the signing up form to Idriss
●	We agreed to complete all the user authentication, and user profile by next meeting which the scrum master set to take place on Monday at 2:30 in the Bahen center


Meeting 3
Time: 26/10/2015 2:30 PM
Location: Bahen 3200
Participants: Facebook chat

●	We decided to prioritize the html/css task over javascript code.
●	Adib helped Joel to solve an error in the javascript code
●	We decided to use bootstraps as our HTML template. We considered HTML5boilerplate, Semantic.UI, and Normalize.CSS as other options but we like the look of bootstraps better


Meeting 4
Time: 29/10/2015 2:30 PM
Location: Bahen 3200
Participants: All group members

●	Met with Mahtab to gain understanding of goals for phase 2
●	Our group decided to decrease the priority of the Chat Room and focus on the Roomview
●	Set the time for the next meeting to be 2:30 p.m. on the upcoming Friday

Meeting 5
Time: 30/10/2015 2:30 PM
Location: The Cube Cafe
Participants: All group members

●	Decided to use cloud code to interchange messages
●	Chose to split Chat Box task between Rafael and Idriss
●	Assigned router function to Cameron in order to be able to redirect different urls

Review & Retrospective (Idriss)

1)	Tasks that were not completed:
a)	Chat room could not be fully completed as it was a complicated task, which we will have to tackle next phase.
b)	Room page had many errors, we could not figure out some of the errors. The errors we solved were mainly syntax errors.
c)	Roomview and categoryview were not fully functional. currently the views do not display any content. 
d)	Linking a video stream for each user was not completed.
e)	Some of the logic around the views was not completed.
2)	Tasks that had to be split before being done:
a)	Roomview had to be split as it was a large task.
b)	Chat box task had to be split between Rafael and Idriss.
c)	The views the master 

Due to our lack of experience in Parse framework, there were additional tasks that we failed to consider in our initial planning. 
●	Creating different views
●	Adding a router function to be able to redirect different urls.
●	Cloud functions needed to code the chat room.
●	Ensuring the logic between the views is clearly defined
●	finding the tools needed to develop a chat room such as web socket, and configuring the server.
●	Router to handle different urls path of the web app.

In our next phase we think that the following improvements could significantly improve the efficiency:
●	The person assigned to a task should be able to seek help if the task is taking way longer than what it was originally estimated
●	Communicate more effectively by sharing code more frequently
●	Scrum master should follow up more often with the people assigned to a task, in order to ensure that they are not falling behind.
